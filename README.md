Clean Up the 6ix is an application designed to tackle the improper disposal of trash seen across municipalities. 
The application is intended for the user to input the trash they are aiming to dispose of, 
and the application outputting where such trash is to be disposed of.

The core of our app is a simple idea to comprehend. With the use of this application, a user can input an item they are unsure of disposing of, and by answering a series of questions the app can narrow down in which bin the trash is to be disposed in. 
The criteria used to narrow down the potential places of disposable were inspired by looking at regional & universally accepted guidelines to do so.
(In particular, we modeled our guidelines based on the region of Peelâ€™s disposal model - as that structure was the one our team was the most familiar with.)
